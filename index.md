I am a **Research Associate at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)** working at the intersection of **bioinformatics, molecular profiling, and clinical informatics**. I build reproducible analysis pipelines and integrate **single-cell & bulk RNA-seq** with pathway analysis to investigate **kidney fibrosis, immune dysregulation, and oncology**. I partner closely with clinicians and scientists to turn data into decisions.
