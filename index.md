# Welcome

I am a **Research Associate at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)** specializing in **bioinformatics, molecular profiling, and clinical informatics**. My work bridges **wet-lab experimentation** with **computational analysis**, focusing on uncovering mechanisms of **chronic kidney disease, immune dysregulation, and fibrosis**.  
I am passionate about integrating **multi-omic datasets, advanced computational pipelines, and translational research** to accelerate discovery in nephrology and oncology.

# Featured Projects

### Kidney Fibrosis Transcriptomics  
- Integrated **single-cell and bulk RNA-seq** to identify immune and fibrotic signatures in CKD.  
- Built scalable analysis pipelines enabling reproducible gene set enrichment and pathway discovery.  
- Collaborated with nephrologists to translate findings into clinically relevant biomarkers.  

### COVID-19 Genome Analytics  
- Analyzed mutation hotspots across **1,000+ SARS-CoV-2 genomes** to identify therapeutic and vaccine targets.  
- Built comparative genomic maps highlighting mutation frequency and conservation across strains.  

### Cancer Cell Line Omics (K562 & MCF-7)  
- Developed RNA-seq pipeline: QC â†’ alignment (STAR, Kallisto) â†’ differential expression â†’ enrichment.  
- Identified oncogenic pathways and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in leukemia and breast cancer models.
