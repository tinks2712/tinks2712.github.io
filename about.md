# About Me

I am a **Research Associate at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)** with expertise in **bioinformatics, molecular profiling, and clinical informatics**.  
My work integrates **single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing** with advanced computational analysis to explore **immune dysregulation, kidney fibrosis, and oncogenic pathways**.  
By bridging **wet-lab experimentation** and **computational biology**, I design robust pipelines, interpret high-dimensional datasets, and translate findings into clinically meaningful insights.
