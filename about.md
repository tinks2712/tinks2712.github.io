# About Me

I am a **Research Associate at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)** with expertise in **bioinformatics, molecular profiling, and clinical informatics**. My research integrates **single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing** with advanced computational analysis to explore **immune dysregulation, kidney fibrosis, and oncogenic pathways**.  

My work bridges **wet-lab experimentation** and **computational biology**, enabling me to design robust pipelines, interpret high-dimensional datasets, and translate findings into clinically meaningful insights. I am particularly motivated by projects that combine **multi-omics integration, pathway enrichment, and translational applications** to accelerate therapeutic discovery.
