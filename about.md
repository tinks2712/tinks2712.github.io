# About Me

I am a **Research Associate at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)** specializing in **bioinformatics, molecular profiling, and clinical informatics**. My research integrates **single-cell and bulk RNA-seq** with advanced computational analysis to uncover mechanisms of **immune dysregulation, chronic kidney disease, fibrosis, and oncology**.

## Skills & Expertise
- **Computational Biology:** scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, CITE-seq, TCR/BCR-seq; pathway enrichment (GSEA, DAVID, Reactome, IPA)  
- **Programming & Data:** Python, R, SQL, SAS; Docker/Singularity; HPC (SLURM)  
- **Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI, GraphPad Prism  
- **Molecular:** Flow cytometry, qPCR, ELISA, Western blot, IHC, Co-IP  
- **Clinical & Regulatory:** SOPs, reproducibility, data integrity; CLIA/CAP/GxP familiarity

## Education
- **M.S., Bioinformatics** — Rowan University (Dean’s List, 3.9)  
- **B.S., Genetics** — Sardar Patel University  

## Mission
I advance **data-driven biomedical research** via reproducible pipelines, multi-omics integration, and translational collaboration toward **precision medicine**.
